        Peter was always eager to contribute new ideas and approaches to design
        sessions. His passion for software development and his thirst for
        knowledge are qualities that I highly value. Peter's eagerness to learn
        new things and willingness to explore new ideas will make him a valuable
        asset to any company he works for in the future. I am confident that he
        will hit the ground running in his new role.
